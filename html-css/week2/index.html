        <h2>Practical web development</h2>
        <p>Since the comercialization of the web, web development has been a growing
          industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use
          their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]</p>
        <p>There is an open software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
          LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of
          learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
          growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development
          software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Visual Studio. Knowledge
          of HyperTextMarkup Language(HTML) or of programming languages is still required
          to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with
          the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials or face-to-face training.</p>
        <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have halped developers build more
          dynamic and active websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver
          applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications
          on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportuinities to decentralize
          information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services
          such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and GoogleDocs. These web services allows users
          to interact with application from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific
          workstation for their application environment.</p>

        <h3>Web development as an industry</h3>
        <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication
          and commerce led by web development include e-commerce.
          Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way
          consumers find and purchase goods and services.
          Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among
          many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting
          experince for many customers. </p>
